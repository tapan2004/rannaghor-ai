# 🍲 Rannaghor AI — রান্নাঘর AI

**Rannaghor AI** (রান্নাঘর AI) is an AI-powered Bengali recipe suggester built for the home cook. Tell it what's in your kitchen — proteins, vegetables, spices — and it instantly recommends authentic Bengali dishes tailored to your taste, spice tolerance, and meal time.

Built as a bilingual (Bengali + English) Progressive Web App using React + Groq's Llama 3, it works offline, speaks recipes aloud, supports hands-free voice navigation, and can be installed as a native app on any device.

## ✨ Features

### 🍳 Focus Mode with Smart Timers
Step-by-step fullscreen cooking overlay with one instruction at a time. An automatic parser detects time mentions in steps (e.g. `"20 mins"`, `"৫ মিনিট"`) and creates live countdown timers. A programmatic chime fires via the browser's native `AudioContext` when a timer ends — no network assets required.

### 🎤 Hands-Free Voice Navigation & TTS
Recipes are read aloud using the browser's built-in Text-to-Speech engine. Voice commands (`"next"` / `"পরের"`, `"back"` / `"আগের"`, `"repeat"` / `"আবার"`) let you navigate steps completely hands-free — perfect for when your hands are covered in dough.

### ❤️ Saved Favorites Vault
Bookmark any recipe with a single tap. Favorites are stored in `localStorage` and accessible from a dedicated sidebar tab — persisted across sessions, no account needed.

### ⚖️ Servings Multiplier & Ingredient Quantities
Scale recipes up or down with `+`/`-` buttons. Ingredient amounts update dynamically and display in the correct numeral system based on the active language (Bengali or English). Each ingredient also supports precise quantity + unit inputs (`g`, `kg`, `tsp`, `tbsp`, `cup`, `pcs`).

### 🛒 Shopping List & WhatsApp Sharing
Missing an ingredient? Mark it, then copy the full list to your clipboard or share it directly via WhatsApp with one tap.

### 📱 PWA — Works Offline & Installable
Service Workers cache the full app shell for instant loads and offline access. Installable as a standalone app on Android, iOS, and desktop.

### 🤖 AI-Powered via Groq Llama 3
Recipes are generated in real time through a secure serverless proxy using Groq's Llama 3 models with structured JSON output schemas. Falls back gracefully to a curated offline mock database (Shorshe Maach, Alu Posto, Dim Kosha, Musur Dal, Egg Roll, Alur Chop) when no API key is configured.
